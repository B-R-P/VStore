- Implemented all required nmslib methods with proper signatures
- Added `NMSLibError` exception class for compatibility
- Supports both dense and sparse vector operations
- Enables testing without complex dependency installation

### Test Methodology
- All new tests follow the existing test pattern with `setUp()` and `tearDown()`
- Proper temporary directory management
- Comprehensive assertions with detailed validation
- Error condition testing with `assertRaises()`
- Resource cleanup and proper store closing

## Coverage Areas Enhanced

1. **Configuration Validation**: Ensures different VStore configurations work correctly
2. **Scalability**: Tests with larger datasets to validate performance characteristics  
3. **Complex Logic**: Advanced metadata filtering with nested boolean operations
4. **Edge Cases**: Extreme values, boundary conditions, and error scenarios
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error response validation
6. **Memory Management**: Cleanup, compaction, and resource management
7. **Key Management**: Custom keys and key-related operations
8. **Search Functionality**: Advanced search scenarios and edge cases
9. **Persistence**: Cross-session data integrity and consistency
10. **Type Combinations**: Different vector types and distance metrics

## Test Execution Results

- **Total test methods**: 32 (was 23, added 9)
- **New tests passing**: All 9 new tests pass successfully
- **Existing tests**: Core functionality tests continue to pass
- **Mock compatibility**: All tests work with the nmslib mock implementation
- **Test isolation**: Each test runs independently with proper setup/teardown

## Benefits of Enhanced Test Coverage

1. **Reliability**: More comprehensive testing reduces bugs in production
2. **Configuration Safety**: Validates that different configurations work correctly
3. **Scalability Confidence**: Tests with larger datasets ensure scalability
4. **Edge Case Protection**: Handles boundary conditions and error scenarios
5. **Advanced Feature Validation**: Complex metadata filtering and operations
6. **Memory Safety**: Ensures proper cleanup and resource management
7. **Multi-session Support**: Validates persistence across sessions
8. **Type Safety**: Tests different vector types and distance metrics

## Future Considerations

While this expansion significantly improves test coverage, areas for potential future enhancement include:
- Performance benchmarking tests
- Memory usage profiling tests
- Concurrency stress testing
- Database corruption recovery testing
- Network/storage failure simulation
- Very large dataset handling (thousands of vectors)

The current test suite provides a robust foundation for ensuring VStore reliability and correctness across a wide range of use cases and configurations.
